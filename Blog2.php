                   </center> 
                   <br>
                   
<h2>1. Check Whether the Plant is Truly Dead or Not</h2>
             
<p2 >
You should look for signs of life in your plant which appear to be dead. You may think your plant is dead when the leaves start to look brown and the stem turns dry. But inside, the branch will surely be greenish, and the remaining leaves will be strong. If you notice this in your plant, then keep going. 
                   </p2>
                      
                   <br>
                  
<h2>2. Get Rid of Dead Foliage</h2>                
<p2>
First, cut all your plant's dead parts to save plants. If your plant stem is also dead, but the root shows signs of life, then cut the stem and only leave 5 cm of stem above the ground.</p2>

<h2>3. Ensure That You Are Not Overwatering Your Plant</h2>
<p2>
We all know that plants require water to survive. But too much water can also be harmful to the plant. Overwatering causes damp soil, which eventually leads to decaying roots. If you are overwatering your plant, then your plant will appear to be yellowish. If you find yourself in this scenario, then to save plants in this condition, keep that plant away from sunlight for some days till the soil dries out.</p2>
                      
<h2>4. Is Your Plant Severely Underwatered?</h2>
<p2>
The easiest way to detect whether the plant is underwater is to check the topsoil in the pot. If you notice the topsoil is dry and has cracks in it, it is a result of the plant and soil receiving less water. To save plants and keep them healthy and cheerful, keep watering until the drainage holes are fully cleared.
</p2> 
                     
<h2>5. Bring Your Plant Where It Can Get the Right Amount of Sunlight</h2>
<p2>
Receiving sunlight is another aspect that can affect a plant's livelihood. As a plant parent, you need to ensure that your plant is receiving adequate sunlight. Not receiving proper sunlight will leave the plant leaves pale and the stem weak. Keep your indoor plants for a home where they can get direct sunlight. </p2>

<h2>6. Adjust the Humidity Level</h2>
<p2>  
Plants from tropical regions require more humidity than you may not realize. You can check for the following signs in a plant to determine whether your plant is receiving less humidity. If your plant is craving humidity, it will show signs of wilting and appear brown. Then you can handle the situation by moving your plant from sunlight to a more humid place.
</p2>
                    
<h2>7. Offer Additional Nutrition</h2>
<p2>  
Sometimes all your plant requires is a little extra nutrition. Common signs of malnutrition are discoloration of leaves and weak stems. To bring your plant back to life, you can use manure and fertilizer in the soil. Use organic fertilizer to provide much-needed nourishment to save plants.
</p2>
                    
<h2>8. Repotting</h2>
<p2>  
The pot might become small for your plant. The roots of your plant might wind around each other, which makes it difficult for your plant to absorb water and nutrients. So, perform repotting occasionally and always use sturdy pots with a sound drainage system.
</p2>

<h2>9. Change the Soil</h2>
<p2>  
The soil your plant grows in may need more nutrients and organic matter. While repotting, filling in nutrient-rich, fresh soil in the pot does wonders to save plants.
</p2>

<h2>10. Compost Your Plant</h2>
<p2>  
If, after trying everything, you still cannot save plants, then compost the remaining parts of the plant and use it as fertilizer for other plants in your garden. Use compost bins for this purpose.
<br>
Now that you know how to save plants perform all the steps mentioned above until you bring your plant back to life. You can get all the necessary products from Ugaoo. Buy all the products required from Ugaoo and save your indoor plants.
